            <pr>A fractal is the name for a never ending pattern that will repeat itself no matter how far you zoom in or out of it.

            When you first see a fractal, you may think they are very complex and too difficult to understand, but in reality they are made by repeating a very simple process.

            Fractals can be found both in nature and also in mathematics.

            <br>
            <br>

            <b>Natural fractals can include things like...</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Tree branching patterns</li>
                <li>The shape lightning makes as it passes through the air</li>
                <li>Brain shape and structure</li>
                <li>Galactic patterns</li>
                <li>Hurricanes</li>
            </ul>

            <br>

            Fractals found in mathematics are generated by calculating a simple equation many thousands of times, each time feeding the previous answer back into the start of the equation.

            Mathematically produced fractals are known as being infinitely complex, this means no matter how far you zoom in to them they will keep on going forever.

            The most famous form of a mathematical fractal is the Mandelbrot Set...</pr>

            <h3>Benoit Mandelbrot</h3>

            <pr>Benoit Mandelbrot is an American mathematician, who  was born in 1924.

            Mandelbrot is most famous for developing a branch of maths known as fractal geometry, which can be used to analyse irregularities in systems.

            He began this study while working for IBM.
            <br>
            <br>

            <b>His research covered a large range of topics including…</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Galaxy clusters</li>
                <li>Fluctuations in the stock marketr</li>
                <li>And even linguistics.</li>
            </ul>

            This diverse range of study led Mandelbrot to the conclusion that all the problems he had been studying were interrelated.

            They all showed patterns of change that were random, but if these patterns were reduced down to their smallest elements, the variations involved kept to the same pattern.

            In 1975 Mandelbrot published a book called The "Fractal Geometry of Nature".</pr>

            <br>

            <pr>This book contained beautiful computer generated graphics that he used to illustrate to the reader the principle of fractal geometry in a visually appealing way.

            Mandelbrot is most famous for his invention/discovery of what is now known as the Mandelbrot Set.

            This pattern is generated by repeatedly feeding an equation into a computer.

            <h3>Double pendulum experiment to demonstrate chaos theory</h3>

            <pr>There is a simple experiment that you can do to see how making small changes to the starting conditions of a system can have dramatic effects on the outcome of the system.

            This experiment involves using a double pendulum to better observe the effect of chaos in a system.

            The video below will go into more details on how this pendulum experiment works and what it means...</pr>
