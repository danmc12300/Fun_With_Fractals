            <h2>How Are Fractals Made?</h2>

            <pr>Different fractals are made in different ways, but the basics involves repeating an equation and feeding it back in on itself over time to create the fractal pattern.

            A good example of this is the process used to create the fractal produced by the chaos game. 

            The chaos game can be used to produce a fractal called the Sierpinski triangle.</pr>

            <h3>Chaos Theory and fractals</h3>

            <pr>In normal language the word ‘chaos’ is used to describe confusion.

            Whereas In mathematical language, a chaotic system behaves in a way that is hard to predict over time.

            This unpredictability is produced by very slight changes to the starting conditions.

            A good example of a chaotic system is the weather. 

            Making small changes in wind strength, temperature and air pressure, can create extremely different weather patterns.

            This phenomenon is known as the Butterfly Effect.</pr>


            <h3>The Butterfly Effect</h3>

            <pr>The idea of the butterfly effect is that if a butterfly flaps its wings in China, it can have dramatic changes on other weather systems across the globe.

            Here is a vidioe that gose into more detail about what the butterfly effect is...

            <h3>How are fractal image or object created?</h3>

            <pr>A fractal image or object can be created by building up many small shapes. The overall fractal will take on the shape of the smaller shapes it is built out of.

            A good example of this is how a twig on a tree has a very similar branching pattern to the overall shape of the tree.

            Chaotic systems can be analysed with fractals. Chaos Theory deals with changes within a system. Fractals are used to show those changes in the form of geometrical images.</pr>
