            <h3>Fractals found in ancient African buildings</h3>

            <pr>Fractals have been found in ancient African buildings.

            Ethnographers have discovered evidence that traditional African societies were modelled on fractal forms.

            Traditional African settlements, when photographed from the air, reveal the fractal structure in the street branching patterns, and the recessive circular dwellings.</pr>

            <h3>The Weierstrass Function</h3>

            <pr>The first fractal known as "The Weierstrass Function", was discovered in modern day mathematics by Karl Weierstrass in 1861.</pr>

            <pr><b>Why is this a fractal?</b>
            <br>
            <br>
            This is a fractal because no matter how far you zoom in, it will continue to produce a ragged pattern forever.
            Similar to the paradox of trying to measure the length of a coast line.
